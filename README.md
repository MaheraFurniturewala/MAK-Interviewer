# MAK Interviewer

MAK Interviewer is web-dev project made with the purpose of making online interviews easier.

## About

With the whole world going virtual because of the pandemic, many workflows need some changes, or rather some helping hands to go through this period without much hassle. Interviewing is one such domain which can use a helping hand, which not only during this pandemic but will also be very helpful in the future.

This is where our MAK Interviewer comes into the picture. We have created this project with all the necessary features needed for a virtual interview.
